> I am a rising junior at Michigan State University, starting to look for roles in the data analytics field. As a data science major I am fascinated by the invisible forces like data that help shape our world today. Why one company succeeds and another fails? With data science and manipulating big data these questions can be answered. With my growing knowledge of data science I want to be able to help businesses grow by analyzing and manipulating their data. By doing this I want to extract meaningful insights for businesses that they are unable to figure out by themselves.
